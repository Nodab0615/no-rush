Solving [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(board_game) Rush Hour] games is a relatively easy task: given an initial board, the complete graph of reachable boards is usually quite small (in the lower 100,000s), and so even a basic BFS search is feasible and actually quite fast.

A slightly better approach is to use the A`*` ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm A-Star]) path finding algorithm, accompanied by some heuristic function h (given a board, h returns an estimate of how far this board is from a solution). The algorithm guarantees to find an optimal solution (if one exists), given a heuristic h that is both admissable and consistent. And the more accurate h is, the faster we reach a solution.

*!NoRush!* is a brave attempt to manufacture the best possible heuristic function. Given any Rush Hour board, the heuristic would return the real, accurate, distance to a solution.

This can be done by building (once) a huge database that matches each possible Rush Hour board to its solution-distance. That's what *!NoRush!* is all about :)
