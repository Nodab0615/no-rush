= Rush Hour Pattern Database =

== Definition ==
A Rush Hour pattern database, is a database that holds, for each legal pattern,
the minimal distance between itself and a solution, or -1 if it is not a solvable pattern.

== Generation==
The Rush Hour pattern database is created through solving the rush hour problem for each
legal board, using several optimizations.
# _progressive generation_: As explained in the [http://code.google.com/p/no-rush/wiki/Patterns Patterns] section, The rush hour patterns may be initially partitioned according to the amount of vehicles in the pattern, excluding the Red Car.
