#summary Rush Hour Pattern Database

= Rush Hour Pattern Database =

== Definition ==
A Rush Hour pattern database, is a database that holds, for each legal pattern,
the minimal distance between itself and a solution, or -1 if it is not a solvable pattern.
The patterns are indexed according to a certain encoding, to be specified later.
The database entries consist of the distance value, indexed in the database by offset according the pattern's encoding.

== Generation==
There are A couple of ways to fill the entries in the database:

The Rush Hour pattern database is created through , using several optimizations:
  # _Solve the rush hour problem for each legal pattern_: Iterate over total possible number of cars in a pattern, and solve for all legal patterns with such number of cars.
This means, that when solving the rush hour problem for any pattern with i cars, you already have a complete database on patterns with (i-1) cars.
Given a specific pattern state, consider the heuristic of taking the maximum, over the database entries of patterns achieved from it by removing a single car.
This heuristic is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_heuristic consistent], rather accurate and fast to calculate, allowing to find a solution for any specific pattern with i cars in a very short time. Notice, that when solving the rush hour problem for a specific pattern, we find a path from itself to an optimal solution. This supplies us with the database entry values for every pattern appearing on this path.
